## Differences between Zulip Cloud plans

### How does having 10,000 messages of search history on Zulip Cloud Free work?

Only the most recent 10,000 messages can be viewed and searched on the Zulip
Cloud Free plan. Older messages are still stored and will become available
again if the organization is upgraded to Zulip Cloud Standard.

### Will you switch to limiting Zulip Cloud Free history to messages sent in the last 90 days (like Slack has)?

**No.** As discussed in [this blog
post](https://blog.zulip.com/2022/08/26/why-slacks-free-plan-change-is-causing-an-exodus/),
a time-based limit to message history is simply a bad model for a collaboration
tool.

## Payment methods

### Can I pay by credit card and/or invoice?

You can always use a credit card to pay. If you would like to pay by invoice,
you will need to sign up for an annual plan.

### How does automatic billing work?

{!automatic-billing.md!}

### How does manual billing work?

{!manual-billing-intro.md!}

#### Manually manage licenses

If your organization is on a manual billing plan, you can manage the number of
licenses on your organization's billing page.

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

{relative|gear|billing}

1. Modify **Number of licenses for current billing period** or **Number of
   licenses for next billing period**, and click **Update**.

!!! tip ""

    You can only increase the number of licenses for the current billing period.

{end_tabs}

## Temporary users and guests

### How will I be charged for temporary users (e.g. limited-time clients)?

Users [can be deactivated](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) any time.
Deactivating a user frees up their license for reuse.

### How are guest accounts billed? Is there special pricing?

For an organization with N other users, 5*N [guest users](/help/guest-users)
are included at no extra charge. After that, you will be charged at 1/5 of
your regular per-user pricing for each additional guest.
