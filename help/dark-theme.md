# Dark theme

Zulip provides both a light theme and a dark theme, which is great
for working in a dark space.

## Manage color theme

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

{!personal-menu.md!}

1. Select the desired theme using the row of icons in the middle of the menu.

{tab|mobile}

{!mobile-profile-menu.md!}

1. Tap **Settings**.

1. Toggle **Night mode**.

{end_tabs}

The default is **Automatic (follows system settings)**, which detects which
theme to use based on the color scheme used by your operating system.

You can also specify **Light** or **Dark** if you'd like Zulip to use the same
color scheme regardless of your operating system configuration.
