# Change the privacy of a channel

{!admin-only.md!}

Channels can be [web-public](/help/public-access-option), public or private,
and private channels can have shared or protected history.
See [channel permissions](/help/channel-permissions) for
details on channel privacy settings.

As an organization administrator, you can always make a public channel
private, but you must be subscribed to a private channel in order to make it
public.
