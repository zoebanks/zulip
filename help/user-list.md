# User list

In the Zulip web and desktop app, the right sidebar shows a list of users in
your organization. It shows
[non-deactivated](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) users, and does not
include [bots](/help/bots-overview).

In organizations with up to 600 users, everyone is shown. In larger organizations,
only users who have been active in the last two weeks are listed. All users are
included when you search for people.

When you view a channel or a topic within a channel, subscribers to that channel
are shown separately from other members of your organization. To avoid
distraction, you can hide the user list any time.
