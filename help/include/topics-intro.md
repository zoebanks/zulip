Zulip is designed around conversations that are labeled with **topics**, to make
communication organized and efficient. It’s easy to get an overview of what
conversations are happening, and to read one conversation at a time.

Here is what topics look like in Zulip.

Topics are one of the most wonderful aspects of using Zulip:

* Lots of conversations can happen in the same channel at the same time, each in
  its own topic. You never have to worry about interrupting — each conversation
  has its own space.
* Conversations can last many hours or days, letting everyone respond in their
  own time. Don't worry about replying long after a message is sent —
  everyone will see your reply in context.

helps transform how your organization communicates.
