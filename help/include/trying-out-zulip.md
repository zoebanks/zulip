1. **Check out the Zulip app**. You can:

    - [View the Zulip development community](https://zulip.com/try-zulip/),
      where hundreds of participants collaborate to improve Zulip. Many parts of
      the community are open for [public access](/help/public-access-option), so
      you can start exploring without creating an account.

    - [See how Zulip is being used](https://zulip.com/communities/) in open
      organizations that have opted in to be listed in the [Zulip communities
      directory](/help/communities-directory).

1. [Create a Zulip Cloud organization](https://zulip.com/new/) for free in just
   a few minutes. This is a great way to explore Zulip even if you plan to
   [self-host](https://zulip.com/self-hosting/).

1. [Invite your teammates](/help/invite-users-to-join) to explore Zulip with you.
   They will have a variety of perspectives on what's important in a chat app.

1. **Run a week-long Zulip trial** with your team, without using any other chat tools. This
   is the only way to truly experience how a new chat app will help your team
   communicate. You can:

    - Customize [organization settings](/help/customize-organization-settings)
      and [settings for new users](/help/customize-settings-for-new-users), but
      plan to adjust the details as you go.

    - [Create](/help/create-channels) your initial
      [channels](/help/introduction-to-channels), including a dedicated channel for
      questions and feedback about using Zulip.

    - Educate others about how to use Zulip's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics),
      and how to [move](/help/move-content-to-another-topic) any messages that
      belong elsewhere.

    - [Set up integrations](/help/set-up-integrations) so that your team can
      experience all their regular workflows inside the Zulip app.
