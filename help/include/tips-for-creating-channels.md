* It's often best to start with just a few channels, and add more as
  needed. For small teams, you can start with the default channels
  and go from there.

* For large organizations, we recommend using a consistent naming
  scheme, like `#marketing/<name>` or `#mk/<name>` for all channels
  pertaining to the marketing team, `#help/<team name>` for
  `<team name>`'s internal support channel, etc.

* For open source projects or other volunteer organizations, consider
  adding default channels like `#announce` for announcements, `#new
  members` for new members to introduce themselves and be welcomed,
  and `#help` so that there's a clear place users stopping by with
  just a single question can post.
