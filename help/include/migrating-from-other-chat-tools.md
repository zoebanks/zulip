If your organization is moving to Zulip from another chat tool, you can use
Zulip's tools to import your data, including users, channels, messages, and
more. Follow the detailed import guides:

* [Import from Slack](/help/import-from-slack). Zulip's [Slack-compatible
  incoming webhook](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming) also
  makes it easy to migrate any integrations.
* [Import from Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost)
* [Import from Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat)

    **You can only import a workspace as a new Zulip organization.** Your imported
    message history cannot be added into an existing Zulip organization.
