You can check out the Zulip app by viewing the [Zulip development
community](https://chat.zulip.org/), where hundreds of participants collaborate
to improve Zulip. Many parts of the community are open for [public
access](/help/public-access-option), so you can start exploring without creating
an account.

You can:

- **Browse recent conversations**. You’ll see a list as soon as you open the
  app, and you can always get back to it by clicking on “Recent conversations”
  in the upper left.
- **Click on the name of a**
  [**channel**](/help/introduction-to-channels) on the left to open a
  list of recent conversation topics. For example, you can explore discussions
  of changes to the design of the Zulip app in
  [#design](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/101-design), or see ongoing
  issue investigations in
  [#issues](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/9-issues).
- **Click on each topic** in a channel to view conversations one at a time.
  Notice how Zulip makes it easy to have many conversations at once, without
  them getting in each other’s way.
