## Startup inspired by MIT's messaging system

Zulip was originally created by Zulip, Inc., a small startup in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.  Zulip, Inc. was founded in August 2012 by the
[MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) alumni team that previously created the
[Ksplice](https://www.ksplice.com) software for live-patching a running Linux
kernel.  Zulip was inspired by the [BarnOwl](https://barnowl.mit.edu/) client
for the [Zephyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(protocol)) instant
messaging protocol, and the incredible community that Zephyr supported at MIT.

## Early acquisition by Dropbox

Zulip, Inc. was acquired by [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) in
early 2014, while the product was still in private beta, which put
Zulip development on hold. However, because they loved Zulip's
topic-based threading experience, Zulip's early customers [continued
using Zulip all through that time](/case-studies/recurse-center/).

> “We strongly prefer Zulip to other options for several reasons – its message
> threading being a key one.”
>
> — [Nick Bergson-Shilcock](https://github.com/nicholasbs), Recurse Center
> [co-founder and CEO](https://www.recurse.com/team), September 2015

## Zulip released as open source!

In 2015, a year and a half after the acquisition, Dropbox generously decided to
[release Zulip as open-source software](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/open-sourcing-zulip-a-dropbox-hack-week-project/).

A group of Zulip's developers [and early
users](https://www.recurse.com/blog/90-zulip-supporting-oss-at-the-recurse-center)
spent Dropbox's Hack Week preparing Zulip's code base for release. The
entire product, including the server, Android and iOS mobile apps, and
desktop apps for Mac, Linux and Windows, was released [under the Apache
2 license](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/LICENSE) with
complete version control history.

The Zulip community is incredibly grateful to both Dropbox and those
enthusiastic early users for making the Zulip open source project possible.
Dropbox has no ongoing relationship with the Zulip project.

## Zulip's second founding

At first, the [Zulip open-source project](https://github.com/zulip/zulip#readme)
was maintained by the project's founder and leader [Tim
Abbott](/team/#the-core-team) on nights and weekends. In the months following
the open-source release, the project quickly gained contributors and users.

It soon became clear that guiding the contributor community in developing a
world-class team chat product would require leadership from a dedicated team.
Thus, in April 2016, Tim Abbott founded a [mission-driven](/values/) company,
Kandra Labs, to steward and financially sustain Zulip’s development.
Incorporating as a business has helped Zulip attract top talent, and has made
Zulip eligible for [large innovation grants](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/) from the
US National Science Foundation, which Kandra Labs was awarded in 2017 and 2018.

## Early days as an open-source company

In its early days, the Zulip community was focused on three main goals:

- Turning an innovative product (that had been in private beta when its
  development was put on hold) into a **polished application**, complete with
  enterprise-ready features like [single sign-on
  options](/help/configure-authentication-methods) and [hundreds of
  integrations](/integrations/).

- Making Zulip more **widely available**. In mid-2017, Kandra Labs
  launched two products: a hosted [Zulip Cloud](/plans/) service, and
  an enterprise support offering for [self-hosted](/self-hosting/)
  deployments. Zulip’s original customers were migrated from Dropbox’s
  servers to the new Zulip Cloud offering, fully preserving their chat
  history. Despite the acquisition by Dropbox, Zulip's customers have
  thus [enjoyed uninterrupted
  service](https://blog.zulip.com/2021/12/17/why-zulip-will-stand-the-test-of-time/)
  since 2013.

- **Building a vibrant community around the project**, with effort and
  care dedicated to making it [easy to get
  started](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html)
  contributing to Zulip. The Zulip development community gathered at
  PyCon sprints [in
  2016](https://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/),
  and led the largest PyCon sprint ever [in
  2017](https://us.pycon.org/2017/community/sprints/), with over 75
  developers contributing to Zulip over course of the 4-day event. By
  late 2016, [more than 150
  people](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/graphs/contributors) from all
  over the world had contributed almost 1000 pull requests to the
  software, and the Zulip project was moving faster than when the
  original startup employed 11 full-time engineers. Zulip also began
  mentoring [Google Summer of
  Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) contributors
  in 2016, and continues to [mentor 15-20 outreach program
  participants](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/overview.html)
  every year.

We are proud to have achieved those early goals for the
project.

## Zulip continues to thrive

These days, we regularly hear from users that they prefer Zulip's user
experience to that of team chat products produced by some of the
world's largest companies. More than 1000 people have contributed a
total of over 60,000 commits to the Zulip project, which has more than
16 thousand stars on GitHub.

In 2020, Zulip experienced an extraordinary increase in usage as a result of
the Covid-19 pandemic changing how people work. During this extremely difficult
time, we found joy in hearing from users about how Zulip has helped them make
[remote work](/for/business/), [research collaborations](/for/research/),
[teaching](/for/education/), and [events and conferences](/for/events/)
successful.

Starting August 2022, [Slack’s free plan change caused an
exodus](https://blog.zulip.com/2022/08/26/why-slacks-free-plan-change-is-causing-an-exodus/)
of open-source projects, researchers, and a wide variety of other
negatively impacted communities to Zulip and other chat
platforms. [Data imports](/help/import-from-slack) from Slack into
Zulip Cloud increased an incredible 40x in the month after Slack’s
[announcement](https://slack.com/blog/news/pricing-and-plan-updates).
